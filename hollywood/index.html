    <h2>Hollywood Wallpaper</h2>
    <p class="description">
      There is a city of dreams, where crossing reality and imagination, where everything is beautiful as the most romantic film and real as in life.
	  Hollywood is synonymous with the glamour, money and power of the entertainment industry.
	  As the show-business capital of the world, Hollywood is home to many famous television and movie studios and record companies.
	  In spite of its glitzy status, Hollywood has humble roots: It began as a small agricultural community and evolved into a diverse, thriving metropolis where stars are born and dreams come true - for very few lucky people.
	  <br /><br />
	  Discover Hollywood. Let your heart fly.
